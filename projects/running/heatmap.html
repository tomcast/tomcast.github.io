      <p>In my day job, I am a bit of a data analyst. I work over data from many different sources and do my best to form it into usable 
      information for various clients. We (the company I work for) make maps, charts and graphs, pretty tables, and sometimes put it all together into 20+ page reports to help said clients make the best business decisions they can.</p>

      <p>After work, I am a runner. Nothing rids my brain of the soft hum of florescent lights like natural sunlight and the comfort of running out in the woods. 2015 was my first year since 2010 where I ran consistently and didn't have to worry as much about the things in life that keep my feet off of the trails and pavement. Armed with <a href="https://runkeeper.com/">Runkeeper</a> on my phone and a spreadsheet, I set off to run 1200 miles in a year, and log as much of the data involved as possible.</p>
